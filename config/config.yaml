# common settings
name: D-MPNN  # str, options: {D-MPNN, GCN, FFN, XGB, LogisticRegression, GraphAgnostic}.
accelerator: gpu  # usually cpu or gpu.

# model
encoder:
  reaction: True  # bool, whether input data contains a reaction or a molecule (e.g. intermediate or product)
  graph_type: bond_nodes  # str, options: {bond_edges, bond_nodes}. If bond_edges, build graph where atoms->nodes and
  # bonds->edges. If bond_nodes, both atoms and bonds are encoded as edges.
  featurizers: custom  # str, featurizers to use for atom and bond features. Options: {dgllife, chemprop, custom}
  hidden_size: 572  # int
  depth: 4  # int, >= 3, number of linear layers (?)
  bias: False  # bool, whether to add bias to linear layers
  dropout_ratio: 9.19216555052358e-07  # float, probability of dropout
  aggregation: sum  # str, options: {max, mean, sum, attention}. Operation to aggregate node-centred feature vectors for graph
  activation: ReLU  # str, any activation from torch.nn can be used

decoder:
  global_features: None # str, options: {"RDKit", "FP", "OHE", "fromFile", None}. Global features to include with the graphs.
  global_features_file: None # str, path to file containing global features. Only used if global_features == "fromFile".
  hidden_size: 103  # int
  depth: 1  # int, number of hidden layers
  dropout_ratio: 9.19216555052358e-07  # float, probability of dropout
  activation: ReLU  # str, any activation from torch.nn can be used
  hidden_bias: False  # bool, whether to add bias to hidden layers
  out_bias: False  # bool, whether to add bias to output layer
  out_sigmoid: True  # bool, whether to add a sigmoid layer at the end of the network

optimizer:
  weight_decay: 0  # float, weight decay for the optimizer
  lr: 0.0003225597324579569  # float, maximum learning rate
  lr_scheduler:
    epochs: 100  # int, should usually be the same as training.max_epochs for the desired learning rate schedule
    lr_min: 3.225597324579569e-05  # float, minimum learning rate
    lr_warmup_step: 2  # int, number of epochs to warm up the learning rate from minimum to maximum
    scheduler_name: exp_with_linear_warmup  # str, see Pytorch Lightning documentation for other options

training:
  max_epochs: 100  # int, number of epochs to train for
