accelerator: gpu  # usually cpu or gpu.

# data
reaction: True
data_name: slap_dataset_reactions.csv
global_features: None  # str, options: {"RDKit", "FP", "OHE", None}. Global features to include with the graphs.
graph_type: bond_nodes  # str, options: {bond_edges, bond_nodes}. If bond_edges, build graph where atoms->nodes and
                        # bonds->edges. If bond_nodes, both atoms and bonds are encoded as edges.
featurizers: dgllife  # str, featurizers to use for atom and bond features. Options: {dgllife, chemprop}

  depth: 4  # int, >= 3, number of linear layers (?)
  bias: False  # bool, whether to add bias to linear layers
  dropout_ratio: 9.19216555052358e-07  # float, probability of dropout
  aggregation: sum  # str, options: [max, mean, sum, attention]. Operation to aggregate node-centred feature vectors for graph
  activation: ReLU  # str, any activation from torch.nn can be used

decoder:
  type: FFN  # str, options: {FFN}.
  hidden_size: 103  # int
  depth: 1  # int, number of hidden layers
